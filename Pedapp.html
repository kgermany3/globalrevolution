<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Pedapp is an extension of
poccils Essentials starter kit, which is itself an expansion on
Flamegurus starter kit. The aim of Pedapp is to add features from the
Generation IV games into the Essentials kit, as well as adding some
things that may have been missing. The kit is designed to speed up
the Pok&eacute;mon fangame process, without taking away all of the
creative input.</FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="Frequently Asked Questions|outline"></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Frequently
Asked Questions</FONT></H2>
<H3 CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Have you done
the Battle animations?</FONT></H3>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">No. The battle animations are
not included in the project. It would take an immense amount of time
to do and I just don't have that time, sorry.</FONT></P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">What is the
difference between the Basic and Complete Versions and why release it
like this?</FONT></H3>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Well, the Complete version
comes with all of the features (at least all of the ones that are
done) whereas the Basic version has some of the additional features
removed. The main reasoning for this was so that those who are
skilled in RGSS and are scripting their own changes in can use the
Complete version as a timesaver and not have to worry about adding
all of the Gen IV stuff AND their own additions. The reason for
having a Basic one as well is to encourage growth in the community. A
lot of people just expect things to be handed to them for nothing.
I'd love to be able to do that, but if everything is already laid out
then what do you gaiun from your fangame? What skills do you learn?
With some of the features missing from the Basic Version it will
hopefully encourage people to learn a bit of Ruby and implement the
missing things rather than just carry on with the missing elements.</FONT></P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Why isn't
everything included?</FONT></H3>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">There is a lot to add, plus I
apparently have things to do in 'The Real World'. I figured that
releasing what had been done and then updating in the same ay poccil
does would be more useful than keeping it to myself until I'm 100%
happy with it (which will probably be never). I'll be releasing
updates as and when I get stuff done.</FONT></P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">X,Y and Z are
wrong!!</FONT></H3>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Great, drop me a PM or comment
on the thread (address supplied at the top of the page!)</FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="New Stuff|outline"></A>New Stuff</H2>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="Tile Tags|outline"></A>Tile Tags</H3>
<P>There are a few new Tile Tags that can be assigned in Pedapp. Here
they are</P>
<P>14:Puddle. Shows you a funky reflection but won't ask you to surf
on it every time you press a button.</P>
<P>15:MediumSnow. Will slow you down a little bit, you can't use the
bike or run in this snow.</P>
<P>16:DeepSnow.Takes foreeeeeeeeever. Can't run or bike.</P>
<P>17:Snow. You can still go at full speed, you just can't use the
bike.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="The Moves/Abilities|outline"></A>The
Moves/Abilities</H3>
<P>Most of the moves that have been added have been placed in the
PokeBattle_MoveEffects script. If you want to take a look to try and
figure out how they work then that's the place to look! the abilities
are scattered all over the place but can be found by searching for
the internal name (usually the ability name, without spaces and in
capitals).</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="The Beauty Condition|outline"></A>The
Beauty Condition</H3>
<P>Despite the fact that neither Pok&eacute;blocks or Poffins have
been added yet Beauty, Toughness, Cool etc. have been put as
attributes. To affect these attributes, check out the familiar
looking kid in the second floor of the gatehouse.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="The Plates/Adaptability|outline"></A>The
Plates/Adaptability</H3>
<P>When Arceus holds a plate, both he and the move Judgment will take
on the element of the plate. He'll also display the correct sprite...
unless he's shiny. I'm lazy. So sue me.</P>
<H1><A NAME="2.Thanks|outline"></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=5>Thanks</FONT></FONT></H1>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">I've
got many people to thank here. Apologies if I missed you, but my
brain has lost 98% of it's hydration while working on this. Here
goes!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><B>Poccil. </B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">If
he didn't do what he does, I wouldn't be able to do what I'm doing.
Excellent work and keep it up!</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><B>Flameguru.</B> <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">The
same as poccil, but with more lines involving 'doing' 'does' and
'done'.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><B>Wichu. </B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">Unofficial
pillar of the fangame community. Provided more help than I can recall
and saved countless hours of my time by pointing me in the direction
of resources I wouldn't otherwise have found.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><B>DE5PA1R.</B> <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">The
guy who poked me into doing this in the first place. I'd thought
about it, but thinking was as far as it had got until he got me
thinking about it.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><B>Shaggy Typhlosion.</B> <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">He's
shaggy, he uses fire and he's always happy to bring things to my
attention. What more could somebody want?!</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><B>Rachael. </B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">For
the unending patience when I'd be sitting in front of her PC at 4 o
clock in the morning, refusing to go to bed because Arceus had
decided to turn into Mario instead of changing type. My love always,
MBHS.</SPAN></FONT></P>
