-ViridianCity:PokeMart, it should be instant fade like Pallet Town:KetchumResidence, so the player doesnt go to the black bits.
-ViridianForest:BugCatcherSamurai - It isnt very "Bug Catcher"-like as the sprite is Team Rocket Male
-Oak'sLab:ProfessorOakSprite - Why has he become a nerd? sure he's a 'nerd' but eh.. lol.
-ViridianForest:Near BugCatcherSamurai, is there some sort of path way in there? i didnt remove it though.
-PewterCityGym: The Helper's Text needs revamping. Brock too, he sounded so ero D:
