ERRORS
(Remove once fixed)

-ViridianCity:PokeMart, it should be instant fade like Pallet Town:KetchumResidence, so the player doesnt go to the black bits.
-ViridianForest:BugCatcherSamurai - It isnt very "Bug Catcher"-like as the sprite is Team Rocket Male
-PewterCityGym: The Helper's Text needs revamping. Brock too, he sounded so ero D:
-

SVN 45 - Error Checking (rei_hunter)
Item : DEEPSEATOOTH, why is it all capitallized?
Item : DEEPSEASCALE, why is it all capitallized? o_o
Item : BLACKGLASSES, some kind of Syndrome?
Item : NEVERMELTICE, Some kind of Syndrome? o_o
ITEM : TWISTEDSPOON, Some kind of Syndrome?
(Note:Firefly - Not sure what the problem is here. But most item names were capatalized like the originals, we can add in lowercase letters as we go along.)


ViridianCity:PokemonCenter:Exit Animation - I saw a "Door" Swinging Close, Also aint them close on sided slide?
ViridianCity:PokemonMart:Exit Animation - The Door i saw was of a different Color o_o (Yellow) 
Lampshades Broke down again.
ViridianCity:PokemonMart:Exit - It makes the players walk to Black Tiles. (That's supposed to happen)
ViridianCity:PokemonMart:The Cashier Register : Is missing it's top sprite (Similar to the Lamshades)


NOTES

Firefly: I have added a backup connection file as the connections keep needing a repoint. This I think is due to use of the visual map editor connection function, which fails to connect maps properly.

Some places in Kanto region isnt 'that' forested, they're more like grassy xD (I'll try to fix that/Though i do wish we had pokemon sprites that could roam around or something)
Johto is pretty forestted (Since it's Forest/Mountain Area)
Orange Island, some were very forestetted, while others are grassy and while others are 'plain'
Hoenn was a mixed of Forestted and Grassy.
Sinnoh was pretty forestted (For a big island lol)
(Note:Firefly - For now leave maps as they appear in the games. We can move on to customisations later, excepting the current extras already present.)
