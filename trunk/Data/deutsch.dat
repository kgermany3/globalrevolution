There is a seed on its back. By soaking up the sun's rays, the seed grows progressively larger."‹To support its bulb, IVYSAUR's legs grow sturdy. If it spends more time lying in the sunlight, the bud will soon bloom into a large flower."‘VENUSAUR's flower is said to take on vivid colors if it gets plenty of nutrition and sunlight. The flower's aroma soothes the emotions of people."—The flame that burns at the tip of its tail is an indication of its emotions. The flame wavers when CHARMANDER is happy, and blazes when it is enraged."Without pity, its sharp claws destroy foes. If it encounters a strong enemy, it becomes agitated, and the flame on its tail flares with a bluish white color."˜A CHARIZARD flies about in search of strong opponents. It breathes intense flames that can melt any material. However, it will never torch a weaker foe."žIts shell is not just for protection. Its rounded shape and the grooves on its surface minimize resistance in water, enabling SQUIRTLE to swim at high speeds."žIts large tail is covered with rich, thick fur that deepens in color with age. The scratches on its shell are evidence of this POKÃ©MON's toughness in battle."–The waterspouts that protrude from its shell are highly accurate. Their bullets of water can precisely nail tin cans from a distance of over 160 feet."Its voracious appetite compels it to devour leaves bigger than itself without hesitation. It releases a terribly strong odor from its antennae."Its shell is as hard as an iron slab. A METAPOD does not move very much because it is preparing its soft innards for evolution inside the shell."–It has a superior ability to search for delicious honey from flowers. It can seek, extract, and carry honey from flowers blooming over six miles away."£A WEEDLE has an extremely acute sense of smell. It distinguishes its favorite kinds of leaves from those it dislikes by sniffing with its big red proboscis (nose)."¢It remains virtually immobile while it clings to a tree. However, on the inside, it busily prepares for evolution. This is evident from how hot its shell becomes."ˆA BEEDRILL is extremely territorial. For safety reasons, no one should  ever approach its nest. If angered, they will attack in a swarm."–It has an extremely sharp sense of direction. It can unerringly return home to its nest, however far it may be removed from its familiar surroundings."¤This POKÃ©MON flies around, patrolling its large territory. If its living space is violated, it shows no mercy in thoroughly punishing the foe with its sharp claws."žThis POKÃ©MON has gorgeous, glossy feathers. Many TRAINERS are so captivated by the beautiful feathers on its head that they choose PIDGEOT as their POKÃ©MON."“A RATTATA is cautious in the extreme. Even while it is asleep, it constantly moves its ears and listens for danger. It will make its nest anywhere."‡A RATICATE's sturdy fangs grow steadily. To keep them ground down, it gnaws on rocks and logs. It may even chew on the walls of houses."ŸIts loud cry can be heard over half a mile away. If its high, keening cry is heard echoing all around, it is a sign that they are warning each other of danger."‹Its long neck and elongated beak are ideal for catching prey in soil or water. It deftly moves this extended and skinny beak to pluck prey."¤An EKANS curls itself up in a spiral while it rests.
