When dawn arrives, the tired CLEFAIRY go to sleep nestled up against each other in deep and quiet mountains."õA CLEFABLE uses its wings to skip lightly  as if it were flying.

One whiff of the honey can result in memory loss. Some fans are said to enjoy this overwhelming stink, however."ûIn seasons when it produces more pollen, the air around a VILEPLUME turns yellow with the powder as it walks.

Their favorite prey are insects that gather around streetlights, attracted by the light in the darkness."åDIGLETT are raised in most farms. The reason is simple--wherever they burrow, the soil is left perfectly tilled for growing delicious crops."éBecause the triplets originally split from one body, they think exactly alike. They work cooperatively to burrow endlessly through the ground."îMEOWTH withdraw their sharp claws into their paws to silently sneak about. For some reason, this POK√©MON loves shiny coins that glitter with light."ÖA PERSIAN's six bold whiskers sense air movements to determine what is in its vicinity. It becomes docile if grabbed by the whiskers."öWhen its headache intensifies, it starts using strange powers. However, it has no recollection of its powers, so it always looks befuddled and bewildered."ëA GOLDUCK is an adept swimmer. It sometimes joins competitive swimmers in training. It uses psychic powers when its forehead shimmers with light."óWhen it starts shaking and its nasal breathing turns rough, it's a sure sign of anger.

But it also becomes much less intelligent."ôIts superb sense of smell ensures that this POK√©MON won't forget any scent, no matter what. It uses its sense of smell to detect the emotions of others."ôThis fleet-footed POK√©MON is said to run over 6,200 miles in a single day and night. The fire that blazes wildly within its body is its source of power."†It is possible to see this POK√©MON's spiral innards right through its thin skin. However, the skin is also very flexible. Even sharp fangs bounce right off it."¶Its body surface is always wet and slick with an oily fluid. Because of this greasy covering, it can easily slip and slide out of the clutches of any enemy in battle."õIts highly developed muscles never grow fatigued, however much it exercises. This POK√©MON can swim back and forth across the Pacific Ocean without effort."~A POK√©MON that sleeps 18 hours a day.
